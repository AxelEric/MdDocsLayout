    <h1>Prepare to update your extensions
      to v3</h1>
    <p>This document lists important changes being implemented as part of Manifest v3, which is the next version of the
      Chromium Extensions platform. The Microsoft Edge extensions team updates this document as the implementation
      progresses. For detailed guidance on migrating your extension to Manifest v3, navigate to <a
        href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv3-migration-checklist"
        title="Manifest V3 migration checklist | Chrome Developers">Migrating to Manifest V3</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="remotely-hosted-code">Remotely hosted code</h2>
    <p>Today, parts of the extensions code is hosted remotely, and not include it as part of the extension package
      during the validation process. While this offers flexibility to change code without resubmitting the extension to
      the store, the code may be exploited after installation. To ensure <a
        href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons" title="Microsoft Edge Add-ons">Microsoft Edge Add-ons</a>
      lists validated extensions, the Microsoft Edge extensions team disallows extensions from using remotely hosted
      code. This change makes extensions more secure. Developers will need to package and submit all code used by the
      extension for validation. Alternatively, you may use the <code>eval()</code> function in a <a
        href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/sandboxingEval"
        title="Using eval in Chrome extensions | Chrome Developers">sandboxed environment</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="run-time-host-permissions">Run-time host permissions</h2>
    <p>At installation time, extensions may request blanket permissions to access all sites and content. These
      permissions allow extensions to operate with minimum intervention, and create a risk to user privacy and security.
      To improve transparency, the Microsoft Edge extensions team provides controls for users to allow or restrict
      access to websites at runtime.</p>
    <h2 id="cross-origin-requests-in-content-scripts">Cross-origin requests in content scripts</h2>
    <p>Today, content scripts request access to any origin including origins that aren’t allowed by the website. The
      behavior breaks cross-origin principles. Going forward, the Microsoft Edge extensions team requires content
      scripts to have the same permissions as the webpage into which the scripts are injected, closing a potential
      security loophole. To perform cross-origin requests, you need to use background scripts to relay responses back to
      content scripts. These changes are available and behind a flag. For more information, navigate to this <a
        href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/extension-content-script-fetches"
        title="Changes to Cross-Origin Requests in Chrome Extension Content Scripts | The Chromium Projects">document</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="web-request-api">Web Request API</h2>
    <p>The Microsoft Edge extensions team replaces <a
        href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest"
        title="chrome.webRequest | Chrome Developers">Web Request API</a> with <a
        href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest"
        title="chrome.declarativeNetRequest | Chrome Developers">Declarative Net Request API</a>, but continues to keep
      the observational capabilities of the Web Request API. Except in some specific scenarios where observational
      capabilities of the Web Request API are required by the extension, the Microsoft Edge extensions team recommends
      using the DNR APIs only. The Microsoft Edge extensions team believes this change will have positive impact on
      extensions that use feature-rich declarative capabilities. As more extensions transition to the DNR APIs, this
      change will improve user privacy, which contributes to enhancing trust in the use of extensions.<br>
      Enterprises may continue to use the blocking behavior of the Web Request API for extensions managed through
      enterprise policies. For more information about extension policies, navigate to <a
        href="/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#extensions"
        title="Extensions - Microsoft Edge - Policies | Microsoft Docs">Microsoft Edge – Policies</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="background-service-workers">Background service workers</h2>
    <p>Service workers are available for testing in Canary. To migrate your extensions from background pages to service
      workers, refer to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/migrating_to_service_workers"
        title="Migrating from background pages to service workers | Chrome Developers">Migrating from Background Pages
        to Service Workers</a>. The Microsoft Edge extensions team is evaluating and investigating the impact that this
      change brings to both developers and users. The Microsoft Edge extensions team adds additional details on the
      change to this document in the future.</p>
    <h2 id="when-are-these-changes-available-in-microsoft-edge">When are these changes available in Microsoft Edge</h2>
    <p>The current declarative net request API implementation is available in our Stable and Beta channels. Test the
      changes, and provide feedback. The Microsoft Edge extensions team contributes to development efforts and
      investigate further changes.</p>

      your code and republish extensions to the store.</p>
